<div align="justify">

  At present I am part of the Institute for Risk and Uncertainty at the University of Liverpool. 
  My current work focuses on uncertainty quantification for engineering (and not only) computer models
  through the DATA-CENTRIC project (with <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=FADIA90"> Dr Alex Diaz </a>).
  More info in <a href="/projects/">Projects</a>.
  
  My research interests are mainly in the areas of computational engineering for aircraft design, uncertainty quantification,
  aerodynamics and machine learning (roughly in this order). I am particularly interested in the principled approach to uncertainty quantification for the design 
  of non-standard and innovative aerospace solutions.

<div align="justify">
  
  I hold a PhD degree in computational engineering and uncertainty quantification from the University of Liverpool.
  I got my Bachelor degree in aerospace engineering at the same university.
